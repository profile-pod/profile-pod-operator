# profile-pod-operator
A Kubernetes operator for profiling applications running inside pods with low-overhead.

## Description
The profile-pod-operator visualizing CPU time spent in the application functions using [FlameGraph](https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html). The operator's goal is to help you pin down where your application spend too much time with low-overhead and without any modification. By not require any modification or restart for existing applications and by using low-overhead profilers, this is great for recording flame graph data from an already running application in production environment that you don't want to interrupt. 

## Profile an application
To profile an application, a `PodFlame` custom resource needs to be created in the same namespace as the target application. Run the following command to create it:

```sh
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: profilepod.io/v1alpha1
kind: PodFlame
metadata:
  name: my-app-flame
  namespace: my-app-namespace
spec:
  targetPod: my-app-54674f9647-jvm98 # The name of the pod you want to profile.
EOF
```
The following optional fields can be added to the PodFlame resource spec:

```yaml
    duration: 30s # The profiling duration in seconds (s/S) or minutins (m/M). default: 2m.
    containerName: myapp # Require when the pod contains more then one container. 
```
> Note: the `PodFlame` resource is immutable, if changes are required to a `PodFlame` resource, destroying the current resource and rebuilding that resource with required changes.


After PodFlame resource is created, an [agent pod](https://github.com/profile-pod/profile-pod-agent) will be created by the operator in the same node as the target pod who was specified in the PodFlame spec.
The agent pod is a high privileged pod, which detect the target application programming language and the target application process id, and runs a profiler suitable for the requested application. Once the Profile is done and flamegraph is generated for the application, it is placed in the `.status.flameGraph` of the corresponding PodFlame resource. Run the following command to get it: 

```sh
kubectl get pf my-app-flame -n my-app-namespace -o jsonpath='{.status.flameGraph}' | base64 -d | gunzip > myapp-flamegraph.html
```


> Note: the high privileged agent pod is created in the operator namespace, therefore, allow any unrestrictive policy in all profiled namespaces when using [Pod Security admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) (PSA) or similar enforcement tools should not be a concern. 
## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/profile-pod-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/profile-pod-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
